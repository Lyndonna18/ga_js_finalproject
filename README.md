Task Manager!

For my final project, I will create an expense tracker for users to keep track of their expenses.
There needs to be an input field for the name of the expense, then a drop down area for the category, and means to add a category that is not supplied Categories include: food, education, entertainment, bills, and travel etc.
Also a calendar/date functionality to add more detail to the tracker.
Lastly the funcationality to submit a dollar amount for the goal for the tracker and a alert when the goal is exceeded.
Stretch goal: Make it downloable?


Overview: summarize the goals of your app, and describe the problem your app is built to solve.
Wireframes: Use a tool like https://awwapp.com/, https://www.mockflow.com/, or good ol zoom whiteboard to create wireframes for your project. Take a screenshot and link to the images in your readme. Your wireframes should walk the reader through the screen states, and should include short descriptions of each screen. It's a good idea to give your wireframes labels (like 1, 2, 3 etc), and to indicate which screens transitions to which other screens.
User stories: a series of statements in the form of "When I {do X}, {Y happens}." These statements should encompass the whole functionality of your app.
React components tree: Diagram out your component hierarchy, indicating which components are parents/children of which others. Indicate which components hold which pieces of state, and which props are passed to each child.
MVP checklist: A list of all the functionalities that will constitute the bare minimum version of your app. Note that this list should be sized so that you can complete it by Wednesday, leaving Thursday and Friday to tackle bonus goals.
Bonus goals: A list of awesome bonus goals you will work on after completing your MVP.
