Task Manager!

For my final project, I will create an app for users to keep track of their expenses.
The users can input a spending limit and their name to personalize the app.
There needs to be an input field for the name of the expense, and the dollar amount for the expense. 

Once they have listed the expenses they have the option to edit individual line items to make changes to their overall transaction history. They will also have the option to clear all of the inputs and start over from scratch.


User Stories:
The user opens the app and inputs their name and spending limit/budget. Upon submitting that information, they are taken to the expense tracker which lets them input as many expenses as they want. The total amount of expenses and the amount of money they have left in the budget is tabulated. 
If the user sees an error in an expense they can choose to remove the expense altogether, or individually edit that line items and submit the edit. The Clear All button will clear all of the inputs and take the user back to the homepage to stat over again!
